//! Lazy creation of the per-workflow worktrees that Meridian uses
//! when auto-managed mode is active in Settings.
//!
//! Auto mode design: the user enters a single source-repo path; the
//! workflow worktrees (implement / pr-review / grooming) are derived
//! as siblings of that source and materialised ON DEMAND the first
//! time a workflow asks for them. No "Create now"
//! button — the path resolvers in `_shared.rs` call the helper here
//! whenever they're hit in auto mode and the target directory doesn't
//! yet exist, so the first IPC into any given workflow pays the
//! `git worktree add` cost (1–2 s) and every subsequent call sees
//! the existing path.
//!
//! Idempotent: if the target already exists, this is a no-op. So a
//! retry after a partial setup just creates the missing worktrees.
