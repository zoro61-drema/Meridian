export const MOCK_TRIAGE_ASSISTANT_REPLY = `Thanks for the context. Here is a concise take for **mock mode**:

**Understanding**  
We are adding Redis-backed rate limiting on the public API, with configurable thresholds and a fail-open path when Redis is unavailable.

**Proposed approach**  
1. Introduce a middleware module that keys limits by client identity (IP or user id).  
2. Load window size and max requests from existing config patterns.  
3. Return **429** with **Retry-After** when over limit.  
4. On Redis errors: log a warning, emit a metric, and allow the request (fail-open) so users are not hard-blocked by infra blips.

**Risks**  
- Mis-tuned limits could frustrate legitimate traffic.  
- Fail-open means brief loss of protection — acceptable if observable.

If that matches your intent, say **finalize** and I will lock an implementation plan (mock mode will inject a canned JSON plan).`;

export const MOCK_SPRINT_RETRO_MARKDOWN = `## Sprint retrospective (mock)

### Went well
- Velocity stable; fewer carry-overs than last sprint.

### Did not go well
- Two PRs waited >3 days for first review.

### Actions
- Try a **review SLA** badge on stale PRs.
- Smaller batches mid-sprint to reduce review load.

_Mock AI mode — substitute real retro text when disabled._`;

export const MOCK_WORKLOAD_MARKDOWN = `## Workload suggestions (mock)

1. **Rebalance:** \`PROJ-214\` (unstarted, 3 pts) could move from **Alice** to **Bob** — Bob is under capacity after closing \`PROJ-198\`.
2. **Risk:** **Charlie** has 8 pts still in progress with 3 days left; consider pairing on the largest item.
3. **Review load:** Open PRs assigned to Alice; if she picks up new dev work, defer one review or reassign.

_Mock AI mode — suggestions are illustrative only._`;
