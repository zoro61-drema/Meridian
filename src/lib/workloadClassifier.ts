 * Classify every developer's load status from a flat list of sprint issues
 * and the current open PRs.
 *
 * Rules (identical to WorkloadBalancerScreen.buildWorkloads):
 * - Average is computed from developers who have at least 1 story point
 *   assigned (so zero-point-only developers don't skew the baseline).
 * - "Needs Review" tickets are excluded from the count — work in review is
 *   waiting on someone else and shouldn't push a dev over capacity.
 * - Every developer (including zero-point ones) is then classified against
 *   that average:
 *     > overloadPct% → overloaded   (default 140; user-tunable in Settings)
 *     < (100 - (overloadPct - 100))%  → underutilised (mirrors above
 *       threshold around 100%, only when avg > 0)
 *     else   → balanced
