/**
 * In-memory ring buffer of recent AI traffic events captured by the
 * sidecar when the developer toggle "Log AI traffic" is on.
 *
 * The Rust backend forwards every `ai-traffic-event` from the sidecar
 * onto a single Tauri event channel. A boot-time listener wired in
 * `src/lib/aiDebugListener.ts` shoves each event into this store, which
 * the debug panel subscribes to.
 *
 * Capacity is bounded — runaway pipelines could otherwise grow the
 * buffer to thousands of multi-k prompt blobs and choke the renderer.
 * Oldest entries drop first.
 *
 * Persistence: events ride in sessionStorage so they survive Vite's
 * HMR module-replacement during development (which would otherwise
 * recreate the store with an empty events array on any source save)
 * and incidental React re-mounts. sessionStorage was picked deliberately
 * over localStorage so the buffer clears when the app actually closes
 * — matching the contract "never remove entries unless I manually clear
 * or close the app". The `enabled` / `dockMode` / `panelSize` / `lastVisibleDockMode`
 * fields are NOT persisted because they're rehydrated from on-disk
 * preferences on every boot (see App.tsx → hydrate()), and persisting
 * them here would race that flow.
