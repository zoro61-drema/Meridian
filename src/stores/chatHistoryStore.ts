/**
 * Per-panel chat history that survives screen navigation within a
 * single app session. Several panels (Sprint Dashboard sprint chat,
 * Groom Ticket grooming chat, Address PR Comments chat) used to keep
 * their conversation in `useState`, which meant a quick navigation
 * away — even via the header tabs — wiped the running conversation.
 *
 * This store keeps the committed conversation turns keyed by panel +
 * a per-panel "context key" (issue key, sprint id, PR id, …) so the
 * thread is preserved when the user comes back to the same context.
 * Switching context within a panel intentionally swaps the thread —
 * the user is talking about a different ticket / sprint / PR now.
 *
 * Streaming text, busy state, and any other ephemeral state stays in
 * the screen's local state — only committed turns belong here.
